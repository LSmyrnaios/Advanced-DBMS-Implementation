# Advanced-DBMS-Implementation
Project for course Îš23a "Software Development for Information Systems"

This project uses the [RadixHashJoin methodology](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6544839) to Join two Tables.

# How to run
Navigate to the root-directory and run the following commands:
1) `make`
2) `./radixHashJoin`

# Unit-testing
We apply unit-testing in our code by using the ["Unity" Framework](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity), which we include directly in "**UnitTesting/Unity-master**".
For **"Unity"** to work, we first need to install "**ruby**" and "**libc6-dev-i386**" by running the following commands in the terminal:<br/>
1) `sudo apt-get install ruby`
2) `sudo apt-get install libc6-dev-i386`
